This Dices aNd Dimes game was inspired by Dungeons and Dragons. A very
crude version of a combat in DnD. More specifically, the final battle
in the tomb of annihilation (a much easier version).

You will find the map and the walkthrough in the same folder of this README.
They should be sufficient in guiding you to victory. In case
you want to have some challenge, you can uncomment the Hard mode in
`game.FinalBattle` and comment the Normal mode section to see what losing
looks like.

There is another file listed more ideas, immediate improvements which
could have been done if we have had a bit more time.
