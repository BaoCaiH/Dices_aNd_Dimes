Improvements:

Immediately the game is not very sophisticated. There are a bunch of unnecessary implementation
and sloppy implementation as well because we needed to think as we go.

Variables and methods could have been handled with more delicate since a few of them are unnecessarily exposed as public.
Which is not ideal but we have no good idea at the time.

Class and Race could be implemented differently, maybe, we have no good idea there too.

Ideas:

Skill/Action could have been handled entirely differently as a separate class and the characters can pick
from the pool which ever is suitable for them.

Same for non-taxing action such as action surge could have been a different class, as FreeAction.

Add actual healing potion item instead of a decreasing variable.

Status could be another separate class as well instead of just String. The cold status
is just an attempt to make the crude game more colourful.

Boosters are real and can be used more. Like traps, a negative booster.
